# Getting Started

Thank you for taking interest in LangDrive!

Langdrive's set of connectors and services makes training LLMs easy! You can get started with just a CSV file, but by providing a Hugging Face API key you can train models and host them directly in the cloud ðŸ˜‰ 

Import and use Langdrive modules in your scripts or configure and execute Langdrive directly from the CLI. The remainder of this article will explore using both approaches for training and deploy models with langdrive. Along the way we will explore the use of a YAML doc to help with the connecting to data and services.


## Using the CLI

Node developers can train and deploy a model in 2 simple steps. 

1. `npm install langdrive --save-dev`
2. `langdrive train --csv ./path/to/csvFileName.csv --hfToken apikey123 --deploy --hfModelPath username/new-model-name`

In this case, Langdrive will retrieve the data, train a model, host it's weights on Hugging Face, and return an inference endpoint you may use to query the LLM. Here's a working [sample dataset](https://github.com/addy-ai/langdrive/blob/main/tests/midjourney_prompt.csv).
	
The command `langdrive train` is used to train the LLM, please see how to configure the command below.

**CLI Arguements**:

- `yaml`: Path to optional YAML config doc, default Value: './langdrive.yaml'. This will load up any class and query for records and their values for both inputs and ouputs. 
- `hfToken`: An API key provided by Hugging Face with `write` permissions. Get one [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens).
- `baseModel`: The original model to train. This can be one of the models in our supported models shown at the bottom of this page
- `deploy`: Weather training weights should be hosted in a hosting service. Default False. 
- `deployToHf`: Whether traiing weights should be stored in huggingface specifically. Either true | false
- `hfModelPath`: The full path to your hugging face model repo where the model should be deployed. Format: hugging face username/model
- `hfTrainPath`: The full path for training environment to be created. Format: hugging face username/spaces_name
- `isPrivate`: Whether the training service and model should be publicly visible.
- `csv`: Path to shared csv training data.
- `path`: Path to shared training data.
- `inputPath`: Path to input training data if not shared.
- `outputPath`: Path to output training data if not shared.
- `inputValue`: Input value to extract from training data.  default: input 
- `outputValue`: Output value to extract from training data.  default: output   

It is assumed you do not want to deploy your model if you run `langdrive train`. In such a case a link to where you can download the weights will be provided. Adding `--deployToHf` will return a link to the inferencing endpoint.

More information on how to ingest simple data using the CLI can be found in the [CLI](./cli.md) docs. For more complex examples, read on...


## Getting Started with YAML

Getting the data and services you need shouldn't be the hardest part about training your models! Using YAML, you can configure more advanced data retrieval, processing, and training/ deployment strategies. Once configured, these settings are available for the standalone API and also from the CLI.

For yaml, langdrive reads the yaml configs from a file called `langdrive.yaml` from the root directory by default.

The information covered in this subsection is included in this [Sample YAML](https://github.com/addy-ai/langdrive/blob/main/langdrive.example.yaml) doc. Refer to the [Yaml](./yaml.md) docs for more information.

### Step 1: Configure Your Data Connectors

Our growing list of data-connectors allow anyone to retrieve data through a simple config doc. As LangDrive grows, our set of Open-Source integrations will grow. At the moment, you can connect to your data using our `email`, `firestore`, and `gdrive` classes.  

In essense, config of these data-connectors is as straight forward as:

langdrive.yaml

    firestore: 
      clientJson: "secrets/firebase_service_client.json"
      databaseURL: "env:FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL"

    drive:
      appType: "desktop"
      clientJson: "secrets/drive_service_client.json" 
      scopes: 
        - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"
        - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly"

    email:
      password: env:GMAIL_PASSWORD
      email: env:GMAIL_EMAIL

You may specify .env variables using `env:` as a prefix for your secret information.

In our example above, the firestore `clientJson` attribute is a [Firebase service account file](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/service-accounts), the drive `clientJson` is from the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), and the `password` attribute in the email config is for an [app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). 

Once this information is provided, the entire __OAuth Process__ will automatically be handled on your behalf when using any associated library, regardless if it's used in the CLI or API. Please refer to our notes on [security](./security/authentication.md) for more information on the Outh2 process when using google. 

### Step 2: Configure Your LLM Tools

Once you have your data-connectors set up, config your training and deployment information.

Training on Hugging Face and hosting the weights on Hugging Face hubs: 

langdrive.yaml

    huggingface:
      hfToken: env:HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY 
      deployToHf: false  

Heres how you could specify the model you want to train, and where to host it:  

    huggingface: 
      hfToken: env:HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
      baseModel: vilsonrodrigues/falcon-7b-instruct-sharded
      trainedModel: karpathic/falcon-7b-instruct-tuned
      deployToHf: true 
    

Simple enough, huh? Here comes the final step.

### Step 3: Connecting Your Data to Your LLM

To connect data to your LLM tool, we will need to create a new YAML entry `train`. 

Here we set the labels of data we want to train on. In the case of a CSV, a most simple example, we can use the `path` value to specify it's location. 

If the csv has an 'input' and 'output' column, all you need to do is specify the path.

langdrive.yaml 

    train: 
      path: ../shared.csv


But just in case, you can set the columns too. 

    train: 
      path: ../shared.csv
      inputValue: inputColumnName        - Attribute to extract from path
      outpuValue: outputColumnName 

You can even specify which datasets to use; they must have equal length entries, however.

    train:
      input:
        path: ../input.csv
        value: inputColumnName
      output:
        path: ../output.csv
        value: outputColumnName 

Now lets show how to query data from one of those third-party services we configured earlier.

To do this, set a `service` and `query` within the `train` entry. Begin by setting the name of a data-connector as the `service` and one of its methods (and its args) as the `query` value. Users are encouraged to explore the service documentation to find available methods and the parameters they take. Once the service, method, and parameters are known. 

    train:
      service: gdrive 
      query:
        getCsvByName:
          filename: midjourney_prompt.csv
          mimeType: text/csv
          directory: false
          directoryId: false
        input:
          value: input
        output:
          value: output

In the example we use the `getCsvByName` method from Langdrive's gdrive class, passing arguements as specified in the Langdrive [GDrive](./api/gdrive.md) docs. `filename` is the filename to retrieve data from. `mimeType` and `directory`/`directoryId` can optionally be used to speed up the file search.

**Note:** Much like `path` parameter in the examples above, the `service` and `query` attributes can be place at the root of the train entry, or nested within an `input` and `output` child entry. 


Lets take a look at another example. 

    train:
        service: firestore
        query:
          filterCollectionWithMultipleWhereClauseWithLimit:
              collection: chat-state                
              filterKey: []
              filterData: []
              operation: []
              limit: 5
        input:
          value: chat.0.content             - retrieved nested Json Objects data
        output:
          value: chat.1.content

In the example, we use the `filterCollectionWithMultipleWhereClauseWithLimit` method from Langdrive's Firestore class, passing arguements as specified in the Langdrive [Firestore](./api/firestore.md) docs. `collection` is the firestore collection name to retrieve data from, (limited to the first 5 entries). `filterKey` and `filterData` are not specified in this example but contain the field name/key to filter. The `operation` value specifies the firebstore query operator to use (For example, `==`, `>=`, `<=` ). 

## Gettings Started with API:

Import Langdrive in your next project

      import langdrive

or

      <script type="module"> import langdrive from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/langdrive@1.0.9/+esm </script>
    
and for select classes: [gdrive]

      <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/langdrive@1.0.9/main.min.js"></script>

Our classes can be exposed in the typical manner. For more information on any one class, please refer to it's corresponding documentation.

Coming Soon: Deploy self-hosted cloud based training infrastructure on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, or Hugging Face. Code is currently being used internally and is under development prior to general release - code avaialbe in-repo under `/src/train`.
