# Utils

This documentation outlines the functionality of a Node.js script designed for deploying a machine learning model. Key libraries such as `fs`, `path`, `js-yaml`, and `dotenv` are used for file system operations, path resolution, YAML processing, and environment variable configuration, respectively.

## Modules

- **fs**: Node.js File System module for handling file operations.
- **path**: Node.js Path module for handling file paths.
- **js-yaml**: JavaScript library for YAML processing.
- **dotenv**: Module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Custom Modules

- **Train**: A custom module that likely handles the training of a machine learning model.

## Main Functions

### `cli_deploy`
- **Purpose**: Entry point for deploying the model. Prints start log and initiates the deployment process.
- **Parameters**: `args` - Arguments passed from the command line.
- **Process**:
  - Logs the initiation of deployment.
  - Retrieves configuration from `getConfig` function.
  - Calls `deploy` function with the retrieved configuration.

### `deploy`
- **Purpose**: Manages the deployment of the machine learning model.
- **Parameters**: `config` - Configuration object for deployment.
- **Process**:
  - Logs the start of deployment.
  - Initializes class instances for various services defined in `config`.
  - Trains the model using the `Train` module.
  - Handles additional deployment steps (commented out in the provided code).

### `getConfig`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves configuration settings from a YAML file.
- **Parameters**: `args` - Arguments passed from the command line.
- **Process**:
  - Determines the YAML file path based on the provided arguments.
  - Reads and parses the YAML file using `js-yaml`.
  - Replaces placeholders with environment variable values.
  - Returns the parsed and processed configuration object.

## Exported Modules

The script exports the `deploy`, `getConfig`, and `cli_deploy` functions for external usage.

## Comments

- There are commented-out sections in the `deploy` and `getConfig` functions which hint at additional functionalities related to services like Heroku and Firebase.
- The script uses environment variables extensively, indicating a dynamic configuration setup.
