- `csv`: Path to training data. The training data should be a two-column CSV of input and output pairs.
- `hfToken`: An API key provided by Hugging Face with `write` permissions. Get one [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens).
- `baseModel`: The original model to train. This can be one of the models in our supported models shown at the bottom of this page
- `deploy`: Weather training weights should be hosted in a hosting service. Default False. 
- `deployToHf`: Whether traiing weights should be stored in huggingface specifically. default true
- `isPrivate`: Whether created services should be publicly visible. default false
- `hfModelPath`: The full path to your hugging face model repo where the model should be deployed. Format: hugging face username/model
